## Overview

### Project Description

This is an easy to use alternative to the TFI Live transit App.

- Search public bus and train schedules across Ireland for their favorite travel routes.
- Save favorite transit stops for quick future access.
- View scheduled and real arrival estimates for upcoming trains and buses. No more wondering when your bus is actually supposed to arrive.
- Select trips to display current or estimated train or bus positions.

### Features

- Search backend SQL database served by REST apis for scheduled public transit routes.
- Leaflet map displays interactive transit stops, route paths, arrival times, and estimated vehicle position.
- Interactive features include travel date/time picker, departure point by stop, and scheduled trip selection.
- Redis realtime transit data cache provides fast trip updates by serving only user requested trips.
- Containerized with Docker for flexible and easy deployment.

Add a screenshot. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above. -->
